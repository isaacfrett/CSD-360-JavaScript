            First Time Snowboarding
        </p>

        <p> 
            My first time snowboarding I felt extremely anxious about falling down, 
            hurting myself, or even looking like a complete <span id = "fool"> _________
            </span>.
        </p>
        <p> 
            And rightly so when I first started out I did lose my balance multiple times 
            and was falling over every <span id = "ten"> __________ </span> feet that I 
            progressed upright. vMy fiance, which was her first time snowboarding as well, 
            was actually doing better than me! We mostly stuck around the training area for 
            the better portion of our day until we finally mustered up the courage to try the 
            easy hill for the first time.
        </p>
        <p> 
            So we started down the hill on the easy path and mainly stock to the sides of the 
            hill while we gradually made our way down, falling this time only every <span
            id="thirty"> __________________ </span> feet. At the end of the day we both were 
            pretty bruised up and neither of us felt like we could walk because of soreness. 
            And the next day was even worse. Overall it was a <span
            id="fun"> __________________ </span> experience and we would 
            definitely do it again only this time we are better prepared for the pain that 
            is to come.
